## 🧠 About Me

I am a postgraduate Data Analytics student with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and AI-based modelling. My background spans both technical roles in IT and academic research in predictive analytics and healthcare imaging. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights through models, dashboards, and applications.

I bring hands-on experience in:
- Machine learning (classification, clustering, forecasting)  
- Deep learning (CNNs for medical image analysis, uncertainty estimation)  
- AI-driven tools and applications (NLP, predictive apps, decision systems)  
- Building scalable data pipelines and BI dashboards for business intelligence  
- Communicating insights clearly for business or operational impact
